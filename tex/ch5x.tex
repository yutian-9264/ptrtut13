\subsection{CHAPTER 5: Pointers and
Structures}\label{chapter-5-pointers-and-structures}}

As you may know, we can declare the form of a block of data containing
different data types by means of a structure declaration. For example, a
personnel file might contain structures which look something like:

\begin{minted}{c}
    struct tag {
        char lname[20];        /* last name */
        char fname[20];        /* first name */
        int age;               /* age */
        float rate;            /* e.g. 12.75 per hour */
    };
\end{minted}

Let's say we have a bunch of these structures in a disk file and we want
to read each one out and print out the first and last name of each one
so that we can have a list of the people in our files. The remaining
information will not be printed out. We will want to do this printing
with a function call and pass to that function a pointer to the
structure at hand. For demonstration purposes I will use only one
structure for now. But realize the goal is the writing of the function,
not the reading of the file which, presumably, we know how to do.

For review, recall that we can access structure members with the dot
operator as in:

-----------  Program 5.1  -----------------------------------
\inputminted[breaklines]{c}{../src/ch5-1.c}
--------- end program 5.1 -----------------------------------

Now, this particular structure is rather small compared to many used in
C programs. To the above we might want to add:

\begin{minted}{c}
    date_of_hire;                  (data types not shown)
    date_of_last_raise;
    last_percent_increase;
    emergency_phone;
    medical_plan;
    Social_S_Nbr;
    etc.....
\end{minted}

If we have a large number of employees, what we want to do is manipulate
the data in these structures by means of functions. For example we might
want a function print out the name of the employee listed in any
structure passed to it. However, in the original C (Kernighan \&
Ritchie, 1st Edition) it was not possible to pass a structure, only a
pointer to a structure could be passed. In ANSI C, it is now permissible
to pass the complete structure. But, since our goal here is to learn
more about pointers, we won't pursue that.

Anyway, if we pass the whole structure it means that we must copy the
contents of the structure from the calling function to the called
function. In systems using stacks, this is done by pushing the contents
of the structure on the stack. With large structures this could prove to
be a problem. However, passing a pointer uses a minimum amount of stack
space.

In any case, since this is a discussion of pointers, we will discuss how
we go about passing a pointer to a structure and then using it within
the function.

Consider the case described, i.e. we want a function that will accept as
a parameter a pointer to a structure and from within that function we
want to access members of the structure. For example we want to print
out the name of the employee in our example structure.

Okay, so we know that our pointer is going to point to a structure
declared using struct tag. We declare such a pointer with the
declaration:

\begin{minted}{c}
    struct tag *st_ptr;
\end{minted}

and we point it to our example structure with:

\begin{minted}{c}
    st_ptr = &my_struct;
\end{minted}

Now, we can access a given member by de-referencing the pointer. But,
how do we de-reference the pointer to a structure? Well, consider the
fact that we might want to use the pointer to set the age of the
employee. We would write:

\begin{minted}{c}
    (*st_ptr).age = 63;
\end{minted}

Look at this carefully. It says, replace that within the parenthesis
with that which \textbf{st\_ptr} points to, which is the structure
\textbf{my\_struct}. Thus, this breaks down to the same as
\textbf{my\_struct.age}.

However, this is a fairly often used expression and the designers of C
have created an alternate syntax with the same meaning which is:

\begin{minted}{c}
    st_ptr->age = 63;
\end{minted}

With that in mind, look at the following program:

-----------  Program 5.2  -----------------------------------
\inputminted[breaklines]{c}{../src/ch5-2.c}
--------- end program 5.2 -------------------------------------

Again, this is a lot of information to absorb at one time. The reader
should compile and run the various code snippets and using a debugger
monitor things like \textbf{my\_struct} and \textbf{p} while single
stepping through the main and following the code down into the function
to see what is happening.\\
